# CS50
My assignment submissions for the Harvard EdX CS50 course over the summmer of 2018.

Week 0: A simple game built on MITs scratch platform to avoid moving objects.

Week 1: An introduction to C. The most challenging problem was 'Credit': a program to validate credit card numbers and check whether they are Visa, Mastercard, or AMEX by implementing Luhn's algorithm.
